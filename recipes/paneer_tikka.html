        <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular Indian dish made from cubes of paneer (Indian cottage cheese), bell peppers, and onions marinated in a spicy yogurt marinade and then roasted in a clay oven, also known as Tandoor traditionally.</p>
        <p>However, a BBQ grill, oven, air fryer, or stovetop skillet works well.</p>
